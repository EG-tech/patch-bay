Normally, this wouldn't present much of an issue, as MIAP's "Old Media Lab" still has several old Power Mac G4 desktops and even a couple Macbook laptops running various early versions of Mac OSX. However, the students would only have access to the digital materials on-site at the partner institution for this project, and could not bring the software back to NYU. They could (and might still, if it comes to it) just bring the laptops to the site and run the software in the native environment, but that's unideal for a couple reasons: first, I'm always somewhat hesitant for department equipment to leave campus; and second, having old hardware running these old operating systems natively is something of a luxury, which our students may very well not have in the future as equipment continues to age, or if they work at an institution with shallower pockets for digital preservation.</p><p>In order to access software or digital files created for obsolete systems, the primary solutions these days are emulation and virtualization - two slightly different methods of, essentially, using software to trick a contemporary computer into mimicking the behavior and limitations of other hardware and/or operating systems. Emulation has gotten incredibly sophisticated recently - the Internet Archive has even made it possible to run <a href="https://archive.org/details/historicalsoftware" target="_blank">thousands</a> of vintage MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 programs from an emulator <em>inside your web browser</em>, no additional downloads required, which is really an incredible feat of programming. Emulators for early Mac systems (anywhere from 1.0 to 9.x) are relatively simple to set up in OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) or 10.11 (El Capitan), likewise virtual machine software like <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> (all topics for another day).</p><p>But right now the early, PowerPC versions of OSX seem to be something of an emulation/virtualization dead zone. I'm not the person to ask why - I'm assuming that the shift from PowerPC to Intel processors (starting with OSX 10.6, Snow Leopard), shifted the system architecture dramatically while the operating system remained relatively the same, resulting in a particular hardware/software configuration that just confuses the heck out of current setups, even through an emulator. It's clearly possible - sift through the forums of <a href="http://www.emaculation.com/doku.php" target="_blank">Emaculation</a> or other emulation enthusiast sites and you'll find five-year-old boasts of people getting OSX Puma to run in Windows XP, or whatever - but documentation is sketchy and scattered even by internet standards, and replication therefore a crapshoot.</p><p>So, how do I help these students get a PowerPC version of OSX on one of their (Intel Mac) laptops? Anytime we need new Mac software in the department, I try it out first on my office computer, a mid-2011 iMac running OSX 10.10.5.</p><figure class="wp-image-202 aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-18-20-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-07 at 9.18.20 AM" width="299" height="486" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-18-20-am-xs.webp 640w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-18-20-am-sm.webp 768w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-18-20-am-md.webp 1024w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-18-20-am-lg.webp 1366w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-18-20-am-xl.webp 1600w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-18-20-am-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>Note: I can't even <em>use</em> some of this stuff, but it's cluttering up my desktop anyway.<p></p><p>I eliminate using VirtualBox almost right off the bat - the makers of VirtualBox explicitly state that the software does not support PowerPC architecture, which, again, doesn't mean it's impossible, but it does mean that unless I magically have the same computer setup as a random YouTube user, I'm completely on my own. Instead I'm going to use PearPC, an old PowerPC architecture emulator (it hasn't been updated since 2011), but one with some <a href="http://pearpc.sourceforge.net/about.html" target="_blank">solid documentation</a> to get started. I'll be trying to install OSX Tiger (10.4) in PearPC, as we still have a couple original installation discs for Tiger still lying around the department, and Apple install discs are otherwise hard to come by (if you don't like going to/supporting super dubious torrent sites, or buying overly expensive copies off Amazon).</p><p>PearPC recommends installing Darwin as your client OS (the OS running inside the emulation software) first, to properly partition and format your virtual hard disk (the fake hard drive the emulator will use to make the OS think it's being installed directly on to a piece of hardware). But I immediately just ignored that because WHAT THE HELL IS DARWIN?! So, I skip to just downloading the PearPC 0.5 source archive for Unix (e.g. Mac) systems.</p><p>Uh oh. A source archive means the software needs to be compiled before it will actually run. Normally I would immediately turn away and go find someone who had already compiled a packaged OSX build FOR me, but the PearPC documentation includes some seemingly straightforward command-line instructions for this step. So, I open a Terminal window, navigate into the PearPC-0.5 directory, and attempt a default configuration and make with</p><blockquote>$ ./configure &amp;&amp; make</blockquote><p>Lots of Terminal gobbledygook aaaaand PearPC seems to automatically detect my system configuration fine:</p><figure class="wp-image-228 aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-46-37-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-07 at 9.46.37 AM" width="531" height="331" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-46-37-am-xs.webp 640w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-46-37-am-sm.webp 768w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-46-37-am-md.webp 1024w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-46-37-am-lg.webp 1366w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-46-37-am-xl.webp 1600w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-46-37-am-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure><p>But then in the make....</p><figure class="wp-image-231 aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-47-55-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-07 at 9.47.55 AM" width="514" height="321" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-47-55-am-xs.webp 640w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-47-55-am-sm.webp 768w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-47-55-am-md.webp 1024w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-47-55-am-lg.webp 1366w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-47-55-am-xl.webp 1600w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-9-47-55-am-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure><p>Oops.

So that's a mystery and if anyone has ideas how to fix this I'm all ears.</p><figure class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-373"><img loading="lazy" src="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-1-15-26-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-07 at 1.15.26 PM.png" width="527" height="415" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-1-15-26-pm-xs.webp 640w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-1-15-26-pm-sm.webp 768w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-1-15-26-pm-md.webp 1024w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-1-15-26-pm-lg.webp 1366w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-1-15-26-pm-xl.webp 1600w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-1-15-26-pm-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure><p>But, for the moment I'm calling this mission accomplished. Again, OSX Tiger in PearPC runs AS SLOW AS DIRT, so this is not ideal, and I would still like to figure out how to crack the VirtualBox solution for all this. But from what I can tell that might involve this mysterious Darwin operating system that apparently makes all my Apple computers work...and given how this post has already turned out much longer than I intended, that's a topic for another day.</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-348 aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/128px-hexley_the_platypus-svg.png" alt="128px-hexley_the_platypus-svg" width="128" height="156" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/128px-hexley_the_platypus-svg-xs.webp 640w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/128px-hexley_the_platypus-svg-sm.webp 768w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/128px-hexley_the_platypus-svg-md.webp 1024w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/128px-hexley_the_platypus-svg-lg.webp 1366w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/128px-hexley_the_platypus-svg-xl.webp 1600w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/2/responsive/128px-hexley_the_platypus-svg-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>WHAT ARE YOU<p></p><p>If you've had any success setting up a PowerPC Mac OS in an emulator or VM, I'd love to hear about it!</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on November 9, 2024</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/tags/emulation/">Emulation</a></li><li><a href="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/tags/software/">Software</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/authors/ethan/" rel="author">Ethan</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/under-the-hood/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Under the Hood</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
