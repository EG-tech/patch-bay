This was excellent news - our <a href="https://patchbaytech.wordpress.com/2017/03/02/upgrading-video-digitization-stations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video digitization stations</a> were not the only piece of equipment that had started lagging a bit and creating choke points around archival projects. But besides breathing new life into some of our existing workflows, this project also presented an exciting new opportunity.</p><p>For the past couple of years, we'd had three contemporary (~2013) MacBook Pro laptops available in our digital forensics lab. These were intended, less for forensics really, and more as a general purpose resource - for MIAP students to use in any course, say, if they forgot their own laptop at home, or their own laptop was having difficulty during a hands-on lab exercise. These were, I think, quite a bit of success, and these laptops continue to be used on the regular. So I ultimately viewed these three computers as a sort of pilot program, justifying a larger fleet of similar laptops that could potentially serve an entire class of 10 or 11 students at the same time (our usual cohort size) rather than just three people.</p><figure class="wp-image-2706 aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/img-3177.jpg" alt="IMG-3177.JPG" width="583" height="437" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/img-3177-xs.webp 640w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/img-3177-sm.webp 768w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/img-3177-md.webp 1024w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/img-3177-lg.webp 1366w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/img-3177-xl.webp 1600w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/img-3177-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure><p>So, in addition to the MacBook Pros already there, we had the chance to add eight more laptops to this supply. Perhaps even more excitingly (for me, anyway), I had the chance to design, from the ground-up, what a "MIAP laptop" should look like - a laptop that, from startup, would be of use to our students in even vaguely digital-related courses... which, yes, is all of them, but especially: Metadata, Digital Literacy, Handling Complex Media, or Digital Preservation. They might also be used for workshops, like my own <a href="http://tisch.nyu.edu/cinema-studies/miap/research-outreach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talking Tech</a> series, or for other invited guest speakers. What would the foundation for all this look like? What programs would you install to educate and demonstrate a wide variety of digital preservation and administration tasks: disk imaging, metadata extraction, metadata manipulation and transformation, digital forensics, file transfer and packaging, fixity management, on and on... while minimizing the time spent installing and managing software later on?</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Freeware preferred, GUIs or CLI; tasks likely to include demo-ing metadata extraction/manipulation/management, disk imaging (2/2)</p><p>— Ethan Gates (@The_BFOOL) <a href="https://twitter.com/The_BFOOL/status/857993702123417600">April 28, 2017</a></p></blockquote><p>What follows is a detailed break-down of each component of these machines: hardware, operating system, and software (both graphical and command line), along with, if prudent, what each program does and why it was selected. When applicable I'll link out so you can download or investigate each component yourself and your needs (probably less broad than mine).</p><p>Thanks to all those who offered feedback to that initial request, or have inspired these choices via many other professional tasks and avenues.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Hardware</span></h2><figure class="alignnone wp-image-2750"><img loading="lazy" src="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/gallery1_2256.jpg" alt="gallery1_2256" width="579" height="310" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/gallery1_2256-xs.webp 640w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/gallery1_2256-sm.webp 768w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/gallery1_2256-md.webp 1024w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/gallery1_2256-lg.webp 1366w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/gallery1_2256-xl.webp 1600w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/gallery1_2256-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure><p></p><ul><li>13” MacBook Air, mid-2016</li><li>2.2 GHz i7 Intel Core processor</li><li>8 GB RAM</li><li>512 GB SSD storage</li></ul><p><b>Why:</b></p><p>Apple hardware has a proven durability - the MIAP media lab houses a fleet of legacy/leftover Mac laptops and desktops stretching back to PowerBooks and a Macintosh SE that are (knock on wood) largely still functional. Anecdotally, the majority of our students have come into the program as Mac users, and are therefore already familiar with using Apple hardware.</p><p>Also, MIAP’s digital preservation/literacy instruction (as with the fields of digital preservation and open source software development at large) is currently favored toward Unix environments (i.e. command line interfacing via the Bash shell, GNU/Linux and BSD utilities). While the rapid development of the Windows Subsystem for Linux in Windows 10 offers tantalizing opportunities for (cheaper) crossover Unix/Windows education in the near future, lingering quirks in the WSL give Apple hardware the “it just works” advantage when it comes to teaching new students digipres basics. (pure Linux machines were not considered, assuming students would be unfamiliar and thus uncomfortable with such platforms, and that our graduates, not necessarily going into systems administration, are more likely to encounter Mac and Windows machines in their archive/library/museum work environments)</p><p>The MacBook Air line was chosen over the vanilla MacBook or MacBook Pro flavors of Apple laptops because of connectivity considerations - that is, available data ports. Given that the 2016 (and onward) MacBook and MacBook Pro lines have only USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, connecting to peripherals, external drives, and video projectors already available in the department would have required a host of new cables and adapters for data transfers and video output  - as well as the need to track the location and use of said adapters. Thus, given its USB (Type-A) and Thunderbolt (Mini Displayport) options, the MacBook Air was considered most flexible in terms of backwards compatibility and most efficient in terms of maintaining current department equipment.</p><p>The lack of a built-in optical drive in the MacBook Air line is something of a drawback in terms of potentially demonstrating optical disc imaging. However, built-in optical drives were discontinued on all readily-available Apple laptops several years back, in any case. A handful of USB-attached Apple SuperDrives (CD/DVD capable) were also purchased to balance this potential shortcoming.</p><p>Intel i7 processors and at least 8 GB RAM guarantee ability to run virtual machines or emulation software at comfortable processing speed/power (e.g. minimum recommended requirements for demonstrating a BitCurator VM).</p><p>Higher cost of 512 GB SSD storage (opposed to smaller 256 GB model) was considered worth the investment for the ability to potentially move/manage/analyze larger collections and files locally without fear of running out of storage space. In either case, SSDs will require close management to avoid clutter - storage should be inspected and evaluated at the end of each semester (files to be kept moved to department’s backup storage, excess/test files removed).</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Operating System</span></h2><figure class="wp-image-2709 aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/os-x-el-capitan.jpg" alt="os-x-el-capitan" width="459" height="274" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/os-x-el-capitan-xs.webp 640w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/os-x-el-capitan-sm.webp 768w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/os-x-el-capitan-md.webp 1024w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/os-x-el-capitan-lg.webp 1366w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/os-x-el-capitan-xl.webp 1600w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/os-x-el-capitan-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure><ul><li>Mac OSX 10.11 (El Capitan)</li></ul><p><b>Why:</b></p><p>Choosing a Mac OS was a trickier consideration. As of summer 2017, Apple only continues to roll out security updates for OSX 10.10.5 (Yosemite) and above, immediately removing any earlier OS version from consideration - exposing students who may be using these machines for tasks as mundane as web browsing to known OS security flaws is unacceptable. And generally speaking, it is the position of this writer that operating systems on professional workstations should be maintained as up-to-date as possible - beyond the security hazards of using older operating systems on a network (laid bare by the global WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware crises of summer 2017 alone), it anecdotally seems to me that archivists and librarians tend to maintain old systems in order to continue using older, favored software, that may or may not encounter issues with newer OS versions. I feel this approach simply ignores the underlying issue of software rot rather than facing it head-on. Rather than allowing workflows to become increasingly unsustainable to the point that they completely break and require the increased effort of redesign around entirely new systems, regular updating identifies problems in software/environment communication *before* they become full-stop crises, and allows for workflows to be regularly tweaked and improved in an ongoing process (particularly when dealing with open-source software, where the issue can be communally raised and addressed) rather than totally reinvented.</p><p>That said - such regular updating and testing has identified some persistent issues with macOS 10.12 (Sierra) that make OSX 10.11 (El Capitan) more appealing for the moment. The OS updates in Sierra were largely based around consumer-driven features: the introduction of Siri and Apple Pay to macOS, increased picture-in-picture mode and tabbing in third-party software, improved iCloud sync, etc. These features have made macOS Sierra a much more demanding OS, in terms of processing power, at no perceived benefit to digital archivists or our students. Other new “features” - such as “improved” download validation that can quarantine archived applications (downloaded in .zip, .tar files, etc.) without notifying the user - have proven actively problematic.</p><p>Continued rollout of Apple’s new file system (APFS), compatible only with Sierra and above, will be worth keeping an eye on, especially when 10.13 (High Sierra) arrives in fall 2017. But as long as security updates are maintained, the stability of El Capitan (plus increased functionality over Yosemite) makes it, for my money, the preferable option right now for a digipres Mac machine.</p><p>Since all new Apple machines come pre-installed with the latest OS (Sierra), this decision required actively downgrading the laptops. Doing this on a brand-new machine, where there is no need to backup user data, is luckily a relatively simple process (and, with solid-state drives, fast), with plenty of thorough <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/how-remove-macos-high-sierra-downgrade-3581872/">instructions </a>available on the internet.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Software</span></h2><h3 style="text-align: center;">Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)</h3><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>General Operation:</b></span></p><figure class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2715"><img loading="lazy" src="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/screen-shot-2017-08-07-at-11-05-23-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-08-07 at 11.05.23 AM.png" width="83" height="77" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/screen-shot-2017-08-07-at-11-05-23-am-xs.webp 640w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/screen-shot-2017-08-07-at-11-05-23-am-sm.webp 768w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/screen-shot-2017-08-07-at-11-05-23-am-md.webp 1024w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/screen-shot-2017-08-07-at-11-05-23-am-lg.webp 1366w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/screen-shot-2017-08-07-at-11-05-23-am-xl.webp 1600w, https://eg-tech.github.io/patch-bay/media/posts/16/responsive/screen-shot-2017-08-07-at-11-05-23-am-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure><p></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> (web browser) - with extensions and options:<p></p><ul><li>    <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger</a></li><li>    <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a></li><li>    <a href="https://www.ublock.org/">uBlock Origin</a></li><li>    set to automatically clear cache/cookies/history on exit (permanent Private   Browsing)</li><li>   default search engine <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>Open source web browser preferred. Given that these laptops were made available to the department of Cinema Studies and the MIAP program specifically under the idea that students should not face any technological barriers to their education in this program, I believe we have a responsibility not to ask students trade their privacy for that privilege. While we do not control the privacy policies for use or administration of NYU’s network or NYU’s Google Apps for Education, we control this hardware, and as is the case in public libraries, have a responsibility to at least maintain privacy via physical access (i.e. multiple students potentially using the same device) and limit outside tracking of our students to the best of our ability and advocacy.</p><p>Thus, our Firefox browsers (set as the OS default browser) come pre-installed with several open-source extensions and preferences designed to enhance web security, limit third-party tracking, and automatically clear personal data like browsing history and passwords.</p><p>Hidden scripts activated at regular intervals (after any overnight/project checkout, or once a month, whichever comes first) by an admin account (AppleScripts borrowed/tweaked from the staff at Bobst Library’s Computer Center!
