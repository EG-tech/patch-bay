It possibly explains some things.</p><blockquote><div>When you were about 2 we experienced technical difficulties with our VCR. It made ungodly noises when rewinding, and soon ceased operation altogether.</div><div></div><div></div><div>Ware [, Massachusetts] being Ware in those days (which is to say, a town in the 1990s which much resembled a town in the 1960s), there was an appliance store on Main Street which advertised TV and radio repairs.  I took the VCR in.  "What's wrong with it?" asked the guy.  "Dunno," I said.  "It doesn't work."</div><div></div><div></div><div>Since the VCR had become an indispensable part of our family existence by that time, the notion of being without one for a week was daunting.  I borrowed the church VCR and hooked it up in the rectory.</div><div></div><div></div><div>The next day you and I were in the family room.  You were puttering around. As I watched, spellbound, you grabbed a fistful of marbles from the marble run, toddled across the room to the VCR, poked in the flap of the tape-insert slot, and were on the verge of emptying your handful of marbles into the unit.</div><div></div><div></div><div>I lunged.</div><div></div><div></div><div>We had a heart-to-heart.</div><div></div><div></div><div>A few days later I returned to the shop to pick up the resurrected unit.  "You'll never guess what was wrong with it," said the guy with a sly grin.  "Marbles," said I.  Half-crestfallen, half-annoyed, he demanded, "If you knew that, why didn't you tell me when you brought it in?!"  "I didn't know that when I brought it in," I said, "It came in subsequent revelation."  He shrugged and asked for 15 bucks.</div></blockquote><div>Watch out for marbles, guys.</div></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on November 9, 2024</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://test.patchbay.tech/tags/personal-narrative/">Personal Narrative</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://test.patchbay.tech/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://test.patchbay.tech/authors/ethan/" rel="author">Ethan</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://test.patchbay.tech/cassette-deck-repair-round-1/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/3/responsive/img_2172-xs.webp" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="2448" width="2448"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> Cassette Deck Repair, Round 1</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://test.patchbay.tech/cassette-deck-repair-round-2/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Cassette Deck Repair, Round 2</div><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/4/responsive/img_2193-xs.webp" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="2448" width="2448"></figure></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://test.patchbay.tech/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://test.patchbay.tech/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
