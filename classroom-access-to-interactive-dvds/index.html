"Sally" is an interactive DVD-ROM in which users can navigate various menus, watch videos, and interact (sometimes via the keyboard, sometimes using audio input and speech recognition software) with a number of characters, primarily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Rand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sally Rand</a>, a burlesque dancer from the mid-20th century. Because it was created/released in 2003, "Sally" has some unique technical requirements: namely, a PowerPC Mac running either OS 9.1-9.2 or OSX 10.2-10.6. At the time, we had to move quickly to make the DVD available for the class - after testing the disc on a couple of legacy OSX laptops from the Old Media Lab, we decided to temporarily keep an old PowerPC iBook running OSX 10.5 in the department's Study Center lounge, where students from the "Interactive Cinema" course could book time to view "Sally". This overall worked fine, although there was some amount of lag (some futzy and not-great sounds coming from the laptop's internal disc drive made me prefer to run the disc off of a USB external drive - better for the disc's physical safety, worse for its data rate), and the disc's speech recognition components were not responsive, likely an issue with the laptop's sound card.</p><p>Fast-forward to August 2017. Submitting her screening list for the semester, Marina let us know that not only would she be needing students to have access to "Sally or the Bubble Burst" again, but she was also expanding the course syllabus to include a number of similar interactive software-based works (by which, I'll define, I mean CD- or DVD-ROMs with moving image material that require specific computer hardware or software components; not just an interactive DVD that will still play back in any common DVD player, which Marina also includes in her course but provide much less of a technical challenge). With more time to plan, I was interested in both more extended testing, to make sure "Sally" and all these works ran more as intended; and to have a discussion with Marina, Cathy, and Ina so we could strategize longer-term plans for access to these works. Quite simply, we are lucky that the department has (largely, I think, thanks to the presence of the MIAP program) over the years maintained a varied collection of legacy computers that could now run/test these works - we may not continue to be so lucky as the years wear on.</p><p>The alternative is pretty straightforward: migrate the content on these DVD-ROMs to file-based disk images, and run them through emulators or virtual machines on contemporary computer hardware rather than worn-down, glitchy, eventually-going-to-break legacy machines. But the questions with these kinds of access projects are always, A) has the content really been properly migrated/recreated, and B) does the experience of using the work on contemporary hardware acceptably recreate the experience of the work on its originally-intended hardware. The latter in particular was a question I could not answer on my own - without having seen, interacted with or studied these works in any detail, I did not consider myself in a position to judge whether emulated versions of these works were running as intended, in a manner acceptable for intense, classroom study. Marina and Ina, as scholars of interactive cinema and digital humanities, were in a better position to make an informed decision.</p><p>So, my initial goals were:</p><ul><li>prepare a demo of emulated/virtualized works</li><li>match each interactive DVD with a legacy computer on which it ran best, for comparison's sake, or, failing the emulation route, providing access to students</li></ul><p>I set aside "Sally or the Bubble Burst", as its processor/OS requirements put it squarely in the awkward PowerPC + Mac OSX zone that has proven difficult for emulation software and <a href="https://patchbaytech.wordpress.com/2016/04/11/powerpc-mac-emulation/">plagued my nightmares in the past</a>. That left three discs to work with, listed here along with the technical requirements outlined in their documentation:</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230405110117/https://chrismarker.org/chris-marker/immemory-by-chris-marker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Immemory"</a> (1997), Chris Marker - for Mac OS 7.5-9 (including "classic" mode on early OSX versions)</li><li><a href="http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=385" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Bleeding Through: Layers of Los Angeles"</a> (2003), Norman M.

We still have the discs and their long-term shelf life will be a concern for another day - today I wanted acceptable emulation of the media contained on them. So by Occam's Razor, I considered Mac's Disk Utility app to be the quickest and best solution in this case to make disk images for demo and testing.</p><p>After selecting a disc in Disk Utility's side menu, I browsed to Disk Utility's File menu, selected "New Image" and then "Image from [name_of_disc]".</p><figure class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3030"><img loading="lazy" src="https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/17/screen-shot-2017-09-29-at-1-43-11-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-09-29 at 1.43.11 PM.png" width="646" height="349" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/17/responsive/screen-shot-2017-09-29-at-1-43-11-pm-xs.webp 640w, https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/17/responsive/screen-shot-2017-09-29-at-1-43-11-pm-sm.webp 768w, https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/17/responsive/screen-shot-2017-09-29-at-1-43-11-pm-md.webp 1024w, https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/17/responsive/screen-shot-2017-09-29-at-1-43-11-pm-lg.webp 1366w, https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/17/responsive/screen-shot-2017-09-29-at-1-43-11-pm-xl.webp 1600w, https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/17/responsive/screen-shot-2017-09-29-at-1-43-11-pm-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure><p>I selected the "CD/DVD master" option with no encryption, which, after a few minutes, creates a .cdr file.

I decided to start with Mac OS 9 - an environment I was already familiar with and which matched at least the OS requirements of all three works.</p><p>For emulating Mac OS 8.0 through 9.0.4, I've had a lot of success with a program called <a href="http://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=7360" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SheepShaver</a>. Going through all the steps to set up SheepShaver is its own walk-through - so I'm not even going to attempt to recreate it here, and instead just direct you to the thorough <a href="http://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/sheepshaver_mac_os_x_setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide on the Emaculation forums</a>, which is what I use anyway. (the only question generally is, where to get installation discs or disk images for legacy operating systems - we have a number still floating around the department, but I also have <a href="https://winworldpc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WinWorld </a>bookmarked for all my abandoned software needs).</p><p>Once I got a working Mac OS 9 computer running in SheepShaver, I could go into SheepShaver's preferences and mount the disk images I made earlier of "Immemory", "Bleeding Through" and "Artintact" as Volumes, so that on rebooting SheepShaver, these discs will now appear on the emulated desktop, just as if we had inserted the original physical discs into an OS 9 desktop.</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-3016 aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/17/screen-shot-2017-09-29-at-12-52-23-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-09-29 at 12.52.23 PM.png" width="724" height="586" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/17/responsive/screen-shot-2017-09-29-at-12-52-23-pm-xs.webp 640w, https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/17/responsive/screen-shot-2017-09-29-at-12-52-23-pm-sm.webp 768w, https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/17/responsive/screen-shot-2017-09-29-at-12-52-23-pm-md.webp 1024w, https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/17/responsive/screen-shot-2017-09-29-at-12-52-23-pm-lg.webp 1366w, https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/17/responsive/screen-shot-2017-09-29-at-12-52-23-pm-xl.webp 1600w, https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/17/responsive/screen-shot-2017-09-29-at-12-52-23-pm-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure><p>First off I tried "Immemory", the oldest work which also only required QuickTime v. 4.0 - which is the default version that comes packaged with Mac OS 9.

How do you update an obsolete piece of software in a virtual machine? First, scour the googles and the duckduckgos some more until you find another site offering abandonware (WinWorld, unfortunately, only offered up the QuickTime 4.0 installer). Yes, you need to be careful about this - plenty of trolls and far more malevolent actors are out there offering "useful" downloads that turn out to be malware. Generally I'm going to be a little more trusting of a site offering me QuickTime 5.0 than one offering QuickTime X - ancient software that only runs on obsolete or emulated equipment isn't exactly a very tempting lure, if you're out phishing. But, still something to watch out for.

But also, I suspect that the OS 9 virtual machine was missing some system components or plugins for the later works ("The Complete Artintact" and "Bleeding Through"), and that the competing requirements (different versions of QuickTime in particular) was causing confusion when crammed together in one virtual environment - in other words, using QuickTime 6 was actually *too advanced* to run "Immemory", designed for QuickTime 4.</p><p>So, solutions:</p><ul><li>keep "Immemory" isolated in its own SheepShaver/OS 9 virtual machine with QuickTime 4</li><li>test "The Complete Artintact" and "Bleeding Through" in a virtual Windows machine, for comparison against different default OS components</li><li>install everything on a brand-new, more souped-up iMac</li></ul><p>Success! Kept alone in its own virtual Mac OS 9 machine with QuickTime 4, "Immemory" went back to running smoothly.

At this point time was running short, and emulating "Sally" seemed likely to be a more difficult and prolonged process. Luckily, we had an iMac running Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard), which includes Mac's Rosetta software installed for running PowerPC applications (like "Sally") on Intel machines. A disk image of Toni Dove's work runs smoothly on that machine, including speech recognition input via the iMac's built-in mic.</p><p>I did also run "Immemory", "Bleeding Through" and "The Complete Artintact" on a Apple G4 desktop running OS 9 and QuickTime 6 - for whatever reason, running this combination of discs and software on the original hardware, as opposed to in the SheepShaver VM, did work acceptably. Though at this point, we accepted the emulation solution for class access, if at any point anything goes wrong, we can move that G4 from the Old Media Lab to the Study Center and run all the discs (or disk images) on that legacy machine, rather than the squiffy laptop solution that we used for "Sally or the Bubble Burst" a year ago.</p><p>So, there is the saga of "Interactive Cinema". Aside from all this is concern that the disk images I made for this process don't really constitute bit-for-bit preservation, and though Marina thought they were all running as intended, these are incredibly broad works and exploring and testing every detail manually was basically impossible. Ultimately, we may want to create forensic disk images off of the CD- and DVD-ROMs to ensure that we're really capturing all the data and can ensure access to them in the future. But for now....it's time for me to take a break!</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on November 9, 2024</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://test.patchbay.tech/tags/emulation/">Emulation</a></li><li><a href="https://test.patchbay.tech/tags/software/">Software</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://test.patchbay.tech/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://test.patchbay.tech/authors/ethan/" rel="author">Ethan</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://test.patchbay.tech/digipres-machines/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> DigiPres Machines</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://test.patchbay.tech/using-bagit-in-2018/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Using BagIt in 2018</div><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://test.patchbay.tech/media/posts/18/responsive/8cfc89a921bd66f75eacaea74ef03d57-xs.webp" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="207" width="207"></figure></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://test.patchbay.tech/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://test.patchbay.tech/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
